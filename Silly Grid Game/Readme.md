# Gameplay

This is a two player turn based grid game. I call silly because I didn't check are there any strategy never squish and play forever. I hope there aren't.
* Each player has three pieces.
* Each turn players have to make these three moves:
* * move 1 square straight
* * move 2 square straight
* * move 3 square straight
* Pieces can't land on same square.
* Pieces can't pass over each other.
* Each piece can move exactly ones each turn.
* Each piece has to move, if can't player lose.
